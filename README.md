# Kosmos

Kosmos is a comprehensive numerical framework designed for general relativity, cosmology, and astronomy simulations. Developed by the Independent Society of Knowledge (ISK), this open-source project aims to provide researchers, educators, and enthusiasts with a powerful platform for exploring the vast realms of these disciplines.

## Key Features

- **General Relativity**: Solve Einstein's field equations and model the dynamics of spacetime curvature in strong gravitational fields.
- **Cosmology**: Simulate the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe, incorporating models of dark matter, dark energy, and cosmic inflation.
- **Astrophysics**: Investigate the formation, evolution, and properties of stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies.
- **Numerical Relativity**: Perform simulations of compact objects, such as black holes and neutron stars, and study their interactions and mergers.
- **Gravitational Wave Modeling**: Model and analyze the propagation of gravitational waves, enabling the study of these elusive signals from astrophysical sources.
- **Parallel Computing**: Leverage parallel computing techniques to accelerate simulations and handle large-scale computations efficiently.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the Kosmos repository are:

1. **Facilitate Collaborative Research**: Provide a platform for researchers from around the world to collaborate, share their work, and contribute to the advancement of general relativity, cosmology, and astrophysics.

2. **Promote Open-Access**: Adhere to the principles of open-access by making the framework and its associated resources freely available to the scientific community and the general public.

3. **Foster Innovation**: Encourage the development of new numerical techniques, algorithms, and methodologies to push the boundaries of computational astrophysics.

4. **Educational Resources**: Offer educational materials, tutorials, and examples to support the learning and teaching of these disciplines.

5. **Industry Collaboration**: Bridge the gap between academia and industry by providing a platform for collaboration and knowledge exchange.
